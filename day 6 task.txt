Question : What is a class ?
Answer : 
* It is a blueprint of an object. Its properties are compulsorily added into the object, but the methods are not. 
* This is the only difference from prototype of function constructor notation.
* By using the class, it takes more memory than function constructor notation.
Question : The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:
* title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
* studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
* rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.
b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.
d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
Answer : 
class Movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    (this.title = title), (this.studio = studio), (this.rating = rating);
  }
  setRating() {
    if (this.rating === undefined || null) {
      this.rating = "PG";
    }
  }
  onlyPG() {
    if (this.rating === "PG") {
      console.log(
        `the name of movie is ${this.title}, production is ${this.studio} , and rating is ${this.rating}`
      );
    }
  }
}
let film1 = new Movie("ravi royale", "eon productions");
let film2 = new Movie("sabitha royale", "eon productions", "PG13");
let film3 = new Movie("chintu royale", "eon productions", "PG");
let film4 = new Movie("minku royale", "eon productions", "PG76");
let film5 = new Movie("tukki royale", "eon productions", "PG");
let arr = [film1, film2, film3, film4, film5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  arr[i].setRating();
  arr[i].onlyPG();
}
3. Write a “person” class to hold  all the details.
class person {
  constructor(name, bornYear, currentYear, qualification, place) {
    (this.name = name),
      (this.bornYear = bornYear),
      (this.currentYear = currentYear),
      (this.qualification = qualification),
      (this.place = place);
  }
  getAge() {
    return this.currentYear - this.bornYear;
  }
}
let user1 = new person("ashu", 1990, 2024, "Btech", "Hyderabad");
// the below code will the return the current age of the user.
console.log(user1.getAge());
4. Write a class to calculate the Uber price.
// I have written object for distance and calculate the price according to distance. 
class uberPrice {
  constructor(distance) {
    this.distance = distance;
  }
  getPrice() {
    if (this.distance < 10) {
      return `the price is ${this.distance * 2.5}`;
    } else if (this.distance >= 10 || this.distance < 25) {
      return `the price is ${this.distance * 4.2}`;
    } else {
      return `the price is ${this.distance * 6.3}`;
    }
  }
}
let user1 = new uberPrice(3);
console.log(user1.getPrice());
